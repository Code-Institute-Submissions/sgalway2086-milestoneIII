# Design
 
## Fonts
* Dancing Script by Google fonts is used due to its rather elegant appearance, bringing to mind the idea of fine dining and sophistication to users, which is suitable for a recipe site
* Kaisei Tokumin is used for the main body of the website due to a clean, easily readable appearance while still invoking a lot of the sophistication and elegance of the dancing script.
## Icons
* Icons will be used to represent options to the player such as next to login/register, for social media links and for deleting items, to create an easy intuitive layout for the user.
## Colours
* A dark grey, a very light grey and off white will make up the main body of the website, trying to keep with the sophisticated look of the fonts and afford maximum readability
## Styling
* The sites styling will be done in a way as to attract a user towards being able to explore the site immediately, with content available front page with not even the need to scroll enticing users, and then being able to reach the search bar easily, enticing users immediately
